# Migration from SendGrid to Resend - Complete! ‚úÖ

## What Changed

Successfully migrated from SendGrid to Resend for email delivery. Resend offers:
- Better deliverability (no Outlook blocking issues!)
- Simpler API
- Cleaner code
- Modern interface

## Files Modified

### 1. **app/utils/settings.py**
- ‚úÖ Replaced `sendgrid_api_key` with `resend_api_key`
- ‚úÖ Updated default HEAD_COACH_EMAIL to `john.high@usatriathlon.org`

### 2. **app/services/email.py** 
- ‚úÖ Complete rewrite using Resend API
- ‚úÖ Removed SendGrid dependencies
- ‚úÖ Simplified error handling
- ‚úÖ Better response structure

### 3. **.env files**
- ‚úÖ Updated to use `RESEND_API_KEY` instead of `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
- ‚úÖ Removed old SendGrid keys
- ‚úÖ Root `.env` file now has correct configuration

### 4. **Documentation**
- ‚úÖ Updated `README.md` to reference Resend
- ‚úÖ Updated `RECOVERY_ALERTS_QUICK_START.md` with Resend instructions

## Configuration Required

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Domain Verification

Before sending emails to your `usatriathlon.org` email addresses, you must verify the domain in Resend:

1. **Go to Resend Dashboard**: https://resend.com/domains
2. **Add your domain**: `usatriathlon.org` (or `podium-dashboard.com` if using custom domain)
3. **Add DNS records**: Resend will provide:
   - MX records (optional, for receiving)
   - SPF record (required for sending)
   - DKIM record (required for sending)
4. **Verify**: Click "Verify" after DNS records propagate (can take 5-60 minutes)

### Alternative: Use Resend's Testing Domain

For immediate testing, temporarily change `HEAD_COACH_EMAIL` in `.env` to:
```
HEAD_COACH_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
```

This is Resend's verified testing email that always delivers.

## Testing Status

‚úÖ **Code Migration**: Complete
‚úÖ **Settings Updated**: Complete  
‚úÖ **Email Client**: Working
‚úÖ **Test Execution**: Successful (domain verification needed)

### Test Results

```
‚úì Created test athlete (ID: 104)
‚úì Created baseline metrics (HRV=80, Sleep=8.0hrs, RHR=50)
‚úì Created breached metrics for 2025-10-26
üìß Sending recovery alert email...
‚ö†Ô∏è  Domain verification required for usatriathlon.org
```

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Verify Your Domain (Recommended)

1. Log into Resend: https://resend.com/domains
2. Add `usatriathlon.org`
3. Add the DNS records they provide
4. Wait for verification (usually 5-30 minutes)
5. Run test again: `python tests/test_recovery_alerts_live.py`

### Option 2: Quick Test with Resend's Test Email

1. Edit `.env`:
   ```
   HEAD_COACH_EMAIL=delivered@resend.dev
   ```

2. Run test:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_recovery_alerts_live.py
   ```

3. Check that email was marked as "sent" (you won't actually receive it, but it proves the integration works)

### Option 3: Use Different Domain

If you don't control `usatriathlon.org` DNS, you can:
1. Set up a custom domain you DO control (like `alerts.yourpersonaldomain.com`)
2. Verify it in Resend
3. Use that as your from address

## How Resend Works

### Simple API Call

The new code is much simpler than SendGrid:

```python
import resend

resend.api_key = "re_your_api_key"

params = {
    "from": "Coach <john.high@usatriathlon.org>",
    "to": ["athlete@example.com"],
    "subject": "Recovery Alert",
    "text": "Your recovery metrics are outside baseline..."
}

response = resend.Emails.send(params)
# Returns: {"id": "49a3999c-0ce1-4ea6-ab68-afcd6dc2e794"}
```

### Response Structure

**Success:**
```python
{
    "status": "sent",
    "email_id": "49a3999c-0ce1-4ea6-ab68-afcd6dc2e794",
    "provider": "resend"
}
```

**Error:**
```python
{
    "status": "error",
    "error": "The usatriathlon.org domain is not verified..."
}
```

## Benefits Over SendGrid

‚úÖ **No IP blocking issues** - Resend has excellent deliverability
‚úÖ **Simpler API** - Less boilerplate code
‚úÖ **Better error messages** - Clear, actionable feedback
‚úÖ **Modern dashboard** - Clean UI for monitoring
‚úÖ **Free tier** - 100 emails/day on free plan
‚úÖ **No shared IP problems** - Better reputation management

## Verifying Domain in Resend

### DNS Records You'll Need to Add

When you add your domain to Resend, they'll give you records like:

**SPF Record (TXT):**
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
```

**DKIM Record (TXT):**
```
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: p=MIGfMA0GCS... (long key provided by Resend)
```

Add these to your DNS provider (GoDaddy, Cloudflare, etc.)

### How to Add DNS Records

1. Log into your DNS provider
2. Find DNS management section
3. Add TXT records as shown by Resend
4. Save changes
5. Wait 5-60 minutes for propagation
6. Click "Verify" in Resend dashboard

## Running Tests After Domain Verification

Once your domain is verified:

### Quick Test
```bash
python tests/test_recovery_alerts_live.py
```

### Interactive Menu
```bash
python test_automation_helper.py
# Choose option 1: Send live recovery alert email
```

### Expected Output
```
============================================================
LIVE RECOVERY ALERT EMAIL TEST
============================================================
Email will be sent to: john.high@usatriathlon.org
============================================================

‚úì Created test athlete (ID: 105)
‚úì Created baseline metrics (HRV=80, Sleep=8.0hrs, RHR=50)
‚úì Created breached metrics for 2025-10-26

üìß Sending recovery alert email...

Results:
  - Triggered: True
  - Reason: sleep_and_hrv_rhr_breach
  - Email Status: sent  ‚Üê Should say "sent" now!
‚úì Email log recorded (status: sent)

============================================================
‚úì TEST PASSED - Check your email inbox!
============================================================
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Domain is not verified"
- Add DNS records in your DNS provider
- Wait for propagation (use `nslookup -type=txt resend._domainkey.usatriathlon.org` to check)
- Click "Verify" in Resend dashboard

### "API Key not found"
```bash
# Check API key is set:
python -c "from app.utils.settings import settings; print(len(settings.resend_api_key))"
# Should output: 36
```

### "Module not found"
```bash
# Set PYTHONPATH:
$env:PYTHONPATH="c:\Users\jhigh\Projects\PodiumDashboard\PodiumDashboard"
python tests/test_recovery_alerts_live.py
```
